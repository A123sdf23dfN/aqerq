        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>Hi, I'm <span>Misbah</span></h3>
          <p>
            I have developed a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and
            am currently enhancing my skills with frameworks like Bootstrap,
            jQuery, and React. My journey into web development has sparked a
            deep passion for crafting responsive and interactive web
            applications. I am excited to apply my knowledge to real-world
            projects and am dedicated to continuous learning and professional
            growth. Though I am at the early stages of my career, I am
            enthusiastic about contributing to innovative and user-focused web
            solutions.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new design trends,
            working on personal projects, or enjoying the latest tech
            innovations. I am always eager to learn and take on new challenges
            to improve my skills and knowledge in the field of front-end
            development.
